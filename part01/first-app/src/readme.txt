*** exercises 1.1 - 1.2
I could've put the names of the parts and their corresponding amount of exercises in a dictionnary, 
and then used a for loop to create 3 parts the Content component but I guess that wasn't the point of this exercise.

*** exercise 1.3
Again could've used an array to store all of the objects.

*** exercise 1.4
Ignore both of the comments above, I should've seen it coming :)
